      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The experts here at Car and Driver have been evaluating and testing
        hundreds of new cars every year since 1956. From performance metrics
        such as acceleration times and cornering grip to consumer-oriented
        insights such as real-world highway mpg and carry-on suitcase capacity,
        we test it all. With more than a half-century of collected data, and a
        staff of highly educated car enthusiasts, we don't claim to be the best
        source of shopping advice. We are the best. Our experts provide detailed
        car-buying guidance by driving every car that enters the market and
        analyzing our own test results as well as automaker specifications.
        Whether you're looking for new or used cars, lease deals or tire
        specials, our Buyer's Guide has it all.
        When it comes to purchasing a car, it is essential for consumers to have a clear understanding of the process and their rights. This is where a Car Buyer’s Guide becomes crucial. A Car Buyer’s Guide is a document provided by a car dealer to potential buyers that contains important information about the vehicle being sold. It serves as a mandatory disclosure under the Buyer Beware Law for Cars, which aims to protect consumers in their car-buying transactions.

The Buyer Beware Law for Cars is a legal principle that holds buyers responsible for making informed decisions when purchasing a car. It recognizes that sellers have more knowledge about the vehicle being sold and may withhold information that could influence a buyer’s decision. To level the playing field, the law requires sellers to provide buyers with a Car Buyer’s Guide, which outlines crucial details about the car.

          <h3>Toyota Supra</h3>
          <p class="texts">The initial four generations of the Supra were produced from 1978 to 2002. The fifth generation has been produced since March 2019 and went on sale in May 2019.[4] The styling of the original Supra was derived from the Toyota Celica, but it was both longer and wider.[5] Starting in mid-1986, the A70 Supra became a separate model from the Celica.</p>

          <p class="texts">
            Created at around the same time as Japanese rivals Honda and Nissan created their Acura and Infiniti luxury divisions respectively, Lexus originated from a corporate project to develop a new premium sedan, code-named F1, which began in 1983 and culminated in the launch of the Lexus LS in 1989.[8] Subsequently, the division added sedan, coupé, convertible and SUV models. Lexus did not exist as a brand in its home market until 2005,

            Jeep's current product range consists solely of sport utility vehicles—both crossovers and fully off-road worthy SUVs and models, including one pickup truck. Previously, Jeep's range included other pick-ups, as well as small vans, and a few roadsters. Some of Jeep's vehicles—such as the Grand Cherokee—reach into the luxury SUV segment, a market segment the 1963 Wagoneer is considered to have started
